# Marble game

This project is a 3D browser-based marble game built with React Three Fiber (R3F) for realistic physics.
Players control a rolling marble and navigate through dynamic obstacle courses with the goal of reaching the finish line as quickly as possible.
The game features responsive controls, smooth animations, and a timer that records performance, creating a competitive and engaging experience.
